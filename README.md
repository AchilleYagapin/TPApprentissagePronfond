# Comments
This is a work in progress. I will soon organize in two branches : 
* main -> the student version, that will be published openly on github
* solutions -> for TAs

# Current status
So far, many notebooks are available, but not in the final form. 
* Session 0 : 0_tensor_manipulations.ipynb deals with tensors
* Session 1 : 1_optimization.ipynb deals with SGD and autodiff
* Session 2 : 2_torch_nn.ipynb deals with torch.nn and other torch interfaces

# Frederic notebooks:
Some of frederic's notebooks are also available (in student form when possible)

## Missing material:
So far we miss a lab material for
* session 4: segmentation
* session 7: xAI and robust AI 

## Overlap
Some session have several potential notebook
* session 2:
  * 2a-regression_pytorch.ipynb
  * 2b-mini-mnist-pytorch-FC.ipynb
  * 2c-mnist-pytorch-FC.ipynb
* session 8:
  * 8a-gan-1D.ipynb
  * 8b-gan-mnist.ipynb*

## Incomplete material
* session 6:  Domain adaptation is not in student form (needs to remove some part)
* session 8: the gan Mnist is not in student form
